for iterm configurations

- make sure line 3065 (or whatever line with `/Users/tko/github/dotfiles/iterm` matches the correct directory where this repo is located)

Copy it over to Preferences, where iterm reads its config.
```
cp com.googlecode.iterm2.plist ~/Library/Preferences/
```

Then unmark "Show mark indicators"
